Known bugs
- If quantity / price / fees are blank when providing trade data, portfolio calculations do not work as expected (when using Load Portfolio)

To be built / implemented
- Move away from using CSVs 
- Ability to delete / clean-up on exit or have login?
- Dashboard for portfolio: change in val over time
- Stock-by-stock performance 
- Make tables / interface look nicer
- Automate entering trade data?
