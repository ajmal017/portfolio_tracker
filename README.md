Known bugs
- If quantity / price / fees are blank when providing trade data, portfolio calculations do not work as expected (when using Load Portfolio)

To be built / implemented
- Add trades section to include dividends
- dashboard for each stock to include performance over time incl buys, sells, divs; trade history; current position / p&l; overview position / p&l
- Dashboard for portfolio: change in val over time; overview position / p&l
- allow hiding certain stocks on portfolio + recalculate position
- Automate entering trade data?
